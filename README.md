# Overview

I've developed a web application as part of my continuous learning journey as a software engineer. The goal of this project is to enhance my skills in web development, specifically focusing on creating dynamic and interactive web pages. While this project is not for any specific assignment, it serves as a playground for experimenting with different technologies and frameworks.

To start a test server on your computer, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies, followed by npm start to start the server. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the first page of the app.

The purpose of writing this software is to apply and reinforce my knowledge of web development concepts, including front-end skills and, dynamic content generatiom.
